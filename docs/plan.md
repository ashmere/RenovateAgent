# **Renovate PR Assistant: Development Plan**

## **1\. Project Overview**

This document outlines a plan for developing an AI-powered code assistant that automates the review and management of Renovate pull requests (PRs) within a GitHub organization. The assistant will intelligently approve PRs with passing pre-merge checks, automatically fix common dependency issues, and provide repository health metrics. This will streamline the dependency update process, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall health of the codebase.

## **2\. Core Features**

### **2.1. Automated PR Review and Approval**

* **Connect to GitHub:** The assistant will authenticate with the GitHub API using a GitHub App.
* **Monitor Renovate PRs:** It will listen for new PRs created by the Renovate bot.
* **Check Pre-Merge Status:** The assistant will check the status of pre-merge checks (e.g., CircleCI, GitHub Actions) on each Renovate PR.
* **Approve Passing PRs:** If all pre-merge checks are passing and the PR is from Renovate, the assistant will automatically approve the PR.

### **2.2. Automated Dependency Resolution**

* **Identify Failed Updates:** The assistant will detect when Renovate has failed to update a lock file (e.g., poetry.lock, package-lock.json, go.mod).
* **Checkout and Fix:** It will clone the repository, checkout the Renovate branch, and run the appropriate commands to update the lock file (e.g., poetry lock, npm install, go mod tidy).
* **Commit and Push:** The assistant will commit the updated lock file and push the changes to the Renovate branch.
* **Language Support:** The initial version will support Python (Poetry), TypeScript (npm/yarn), and Go.

### **2.3. Repository Health Metrics via GitHub Issue**

* **Create/Update a Dashboard Issue:** The assistant will maintain a single, pinned issue in each repository titled "Renovate PRs Assistant Dashboard".
* **Track Open Renovate PRs:** This issue will contain a human-readable report of all open Renovate PRs.
* **Identify Blocked PRs:** The report will highlight PRs that are blocked due to rate limiting, merge conflicts, or requiring manual approval.
* **Structured Data:** The issue body will contain a hidden HTML comment with structured data (e.g., JSON) for the agent to read and update, ensuring the human-readable part remains clean.

## **3\. Architecture**

The Renovate PR Assistant will be a modular, stateless system composed of the following components:

* **GitHub Webhook Listener:** A web service that listens for GitHub webhook events (e.g., pull\_request, check\_suite).
* **PR Processing Engine:** The core logic of the assistant. It will receive webhook events, analyze PRs, and decide on the appropriate action (e.g., approve, fix dependencies).
* **Dependency Fixer:** A module that contains the logic for fixing dependency issues for each supported language.
* **GitHub API Client:** A robust client for interacting with the GitHub REST API. A well-supported library (e.g., PyGithub for Python) or a lower-level HTTP client would be suitable.
* **GitHub Issue State Manager:** A module responsible for reading from and writing to the dashboard issue in each repository, managing both the human-readable report and the hidden structured data.

```

## **4\. Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Functionality (2-3 weeks)**

1. **Setup GitHub App:** Create a new GitHub App with the necessary permissions (e.g., pull\_requests:write, checks:read, contents:write, issues:write).
2. **Build Webhook Listener:** Create a simple web service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) to receive and parse GitHub webhooks.
3. **Implement PR Approval:** Implement the logic for checking pre-merge statuses and approving PRs.
4. **Setup GitHub API Client:** Choose and set up a standard GitHub REST API library to handle interactions like fetching PRs and their statuses.

### **Phase 2: Dependency Fixing (3-4 weeks)**

1. **Implement Python (Poetry) Fixer:** Implement the logic for updating poetry.lock files.
2. **Implement TypeScript (npm/yarn) Fixer:** Implement the logic for updating package-lock.json or yarn.lock files.
3. **Implement Go Fixer:** Implement the logic for updating go.mod and go.sum files.
4. **Integrate Dependency Fixer:** Connect the dependency fixer to the PR processing engine.

### **Phase 3: GitHub Issue Dashboard (2-3 weeks)**

1. **Implement Issue Manager:** Build the GitHub Issue State Manager component. It will be responsible for finding, creating, and updating the dashboard issue.
2. **Define Data Structure:** Define the JSON schema for the structured data to be stored in the issue body.
3. **Generate Human-Readable Report:** Create a function to generate a clean, Markdown-based report from the structured data.
4. **Update Logic:** Integrate the issue manager with the PR processing engine to update the dashboard issue whenever a relevant event occurs.

## **5\. Future Roadmap**

### **5.1. Slack Integration**

* **Notify on Failures:** The assistant will send a notification to a designated Slack channel when it is unable to fix a dependency issue.
* **Weekly Summary:** It will post a weekly summary of its activities (e.g., PRs approved, issues fixed) to a Slack channel.

### **5.2. Expanded Language Support**

* Add support for other languages and dependency managers (e.g., Java/Maven, Ruby/Bundler).

### **5.3. Advanced AI Features**

* **Automated Code Changes:** The assistant could be trained to make simple code changes to fix compatibility issues with new dependency versions.
* **Security Vulnerability Detection:** It could be integrated with security scanning tools to identify and flag vulnerabilities in dependencies.
